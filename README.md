# IA-Rasende-Roboter

A student project for the IA41 course. We used the ipseity platform that you can download here : http://www.ipseity-project.com/index.php/main-downloads

You should download the ipseity kernel (without python) and the Rasende Roboter environment.
You can download the binaries files only but in order to understand how it works please download the sources files.
This github repositorie contains only cognitive system files. This cognitive system need to be build and then used as an IA for a taxon.
